I am a first-year PhD student in the Division of Computational & Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Optimization Applications in health care and operations Research based on decision-making.

I have a background in medical image analysis research based on machine learning methods. While I was studying Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, I worked in Prof. Adam Charlesâ€™ group, aiming to construct a pipeline for dealing with the denoising and detection of synaptic images. At the same time, I am working on efficient bias-field removal in medical images under the guidance of Prof. Martin Reuter, together with my collaborators.

Also, I really enjoy watching movies, and going to the gym, and always look forward to casual trips as seasons change.
